## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This Haonan Chang. I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. student at Rutgers Student major in robotics advised by Prof. Abdeslam Boularias. I focus on developing and deploying foundation models, such as LLMs, VLMs, and Video Diffusion
Models, for robotic manipulation and navigation systems. I also specialize in scene understanding,
3D reconstruction, and SLAM.
